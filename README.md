# Sets Counter

An app for Android to keep track of the sets left in the current workout, which also includes a timer so the user knows how long breaks he should take. The idea (might change later on) is that you tap to start the break, tap again to pause and take the set, tap again to reset the timer. The app should keep track of how many sets you have taken and would indicate that you have reached your goal.
